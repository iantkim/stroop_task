"Cohen, Dunbar, and McClelland 1990 - On the Control of Automatic Processes: A Parallel Distributed Processing Account of the Stroop Effect"

v2: revamped forward model structure, as the input dimensions were confusing; bias needs to be fixed

v3: bias updated according to paper; comparison of training model's test performance vs. paper parameter test performance
